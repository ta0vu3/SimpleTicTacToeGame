Minimum Requirements for Final Project include: Must use the OOP Principals Must use at least two package Must include at least Six classes Must use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) Must use GitHub

Project Proposal This will be based off of a programming assingment from Chapter 17: Design and code a Swing GUI for a two-player tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) game on a 3 X 3 game board. The JFrame should use a BorderLayout with a JLabel in the NORTH region to display messages (e.g., who won the game), and a JPanel in the CENTER region to display the game board. For the game board in the JPanel, use a GridLayout manager with a 3 X 3 layout of JButton's in each cell to display the game board. The button label should initially be blank. When a player clicks on an empty button, an appropriate "X" or "O" should be placed in the label field of the button. If there is a winner (three in a row), then the program should display the winer in the JLabel located a the top of the window. If all nine cells have been filled without a winner, the program should indicate that there is a tie.
